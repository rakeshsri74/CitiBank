What is Web Service?
    -It is a client-server application or application component for communication
    -The method of communication between two devices over the network.
    -It is software system for the interoperable machine to machine communication.
          
          
  SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol)
  REST(Representational State Transfer)
  GraphQL
  
  1.SOAP
  2.REST(GET,POST,PUT and DELETE)
       -Typically use JSON or XML for data exchange
       -are more lightweight
       
 http://localhost:8000/stocks
 
 2.Understanding HTTP:
     Request Method(HTTP Verbs):
         -GET:
         -POSt:
         -PUT:
         -DELETE:
         
   Status Code:
       -Indicates the outcome of an HTTP request.They are grouped into five categories
       
       1XX : Informational
       2XX : Success
       3XX : Redirection
       4XX : Client Error
       5XX : Server Error
       
  3. Tools And Technologies Used To Develop RESt:
  
      Java - JAX-RS or SpringBoot
      
      Postman : A popular tool for API testing , collaboration , and documentation.
      
  4.Designing The REST API
  
      1.Identify Resources:/users,/products or /orders
      2.Define URIs:URIs should represent nouns (resources) and use plural noun for collections
      3.Use HTTP methods:
      4.Use HTTP status code:Return appropriate HTTP status codes with resources to indicate the success or failure of         
        requests.
        
        200 -- OK
        201 -- Created
        204 -- No Content
        400 -- Bad Request
        401 -- Unauthorized
        404 -- Not Found
        405 -- Method not allowed
        500 -- Internal Server Error
        
        Request and Response Payloads : JSON or XML
        
   5. Java and Rest:
       SpringBoot
       JAX-RS
       Jackson/GSON
       JPA:
       Testing Libraries:
           Junit,Mockito,@WebMVC
           Jupiter
       Dependency Management Tools:Maven or Gradle
       Security Libraries:Authentication,Authorization(OAuth or JWT)
   6.Spring Boot and Rest
       What is springboot?
           Spring Boot is an open source java based framework that simplifies the process of building and deploying standalone,production grade spring based application.It provides a convention over configuration means that it reduces the amount of configuration required for setting up and running spring application.
           
           Key Features of Spring Boot:
               1.Embedded server : 
               2.Opinionated Default :
               3.AutoConfiguration
               4.Standalone
               5.SpringInitializer
               
    @RestController
    public class StockController {
    //@GetMapping("/stocks")
    @RequestMapping(path="/stocks",method=RequestMethod.GET)
    public String stockData() {
        return "Here is stock data";
    }

}

@SpringBootApplication:It is a convenient annotation provided by the spring boot framework that combines three commonly used annotations.
1.@SpringBootConfiguration:This annotation is used to indicates that the class provides configuration to the spring application context.It's a specialized form of the @Configuration annotation.

2.@EnableAutoConfiguration:This annotation tells Spring Boot to automatically configure the application based on its dependencies and the classpath.It enables spring boot's auto configuration feature,which reduces the need of manual configuration

3.@ComponentScan:This annotation tells spring to scan and discover other Spring components,such as Controller,Services,and Repositories,in the package and its aub-package where the application class is located.

Difference between @Controller and @RestController

@RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody

8.Spring @RequestBody and @ResponseBody

9.Spring @ResponseStatus to set HttpStatus Code

10.Resource In Rest

http://localhost:8080/stocks

11.Messages in Rest
